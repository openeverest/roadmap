## ❓ FAQs

### Why do you share your roadmap publicly?

We share our roadmap because our community and customers make plans based on our development efforts. We want to provide the insights you need for better planning and decision-making.

### Why are there no specific dates on the roadmap?

We prioritize security and operational stability, which means we cannot provide specific target launch dates for features. The roadmap is subject to change at any time, and issues in this repository do not guarantee a feature will be launched as proposed.

### Is every development effort on this roadmap?

The majority of our development work is included here. However, there may be smaller technologies or surprise features we launch without notice to delight our users.

### How can I provide feedback or suggest a new feature?

Please open an issue!

* To provide **feedback** on existing items or ask for more information, [open an issue](https://github.com/openeverest/roadmap/issues/new/choose).
* To **request a new feature**, [open an issue](https://github.com/openeverest/roadmap/issues/new/choose) and it will be tagged "Proposed" for review by the team.

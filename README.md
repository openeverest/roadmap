## ❓ FAQs

### Why do you share your roadmap publicly?
We want to provide insights that help our community and customers make better decisions based on our development efforts.

### Why are there no specific dates?
We prioritize security and operational stability over fixed deadlines. While we strive to meet our goals, the roadmap is subject to change. Issues in this repository are not a guarantee of a specific launch date.

### Is every development effort on this roadmap?
Most of our work is included here. However, we occasionally launch smaller updates or "surprise" features without prior notice to delight our users.
